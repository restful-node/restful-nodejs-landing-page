Hey 👋 I'm Yichen Zhu!

I've always found there was a lack of resources when it comes to what the best practices and guidelines are when designing a RESTful API. Not only that, but how to implement and structure a large-scale web API in Node.js.

Over the last few years, I've helped build and maintain dozens of enterprise-grade RESTful web APIs ranging from small startups to large corporate companies. During those years, I’ve observed the good, the bad, and the ugly.

This is what lead me to write this book: A collection of learnings and good practices when building large RESTful web APIs in Node.js at scale.

My goal is to make sure that you are successfully able to create a RESTful API in Node.js that will withstand the test of time by bringing proper guidelines and practices and a structured way of writing code.
